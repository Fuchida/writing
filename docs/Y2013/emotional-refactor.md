title: Emotional Refactor
date: 2013

When it comes to learning concepts and then coding my way to a solution or implementation, I feel this weight of sadness when I have to wipe the slate clean, deleting the code and starting over.

I want to start over because I know I can write cleaner, well factored and testable code the next time around.

But it's so hard to press `ctrl+a Delete` on my old code, it feels like I created this living thing - not perfect but gets the job done- and now I have to destroy it in order for something better to exist.

A heavy heart everytime I refactor.
