title: Git Quick Setup
date: 2013

Here is another piece of common git commands I keep forgetting. I think the reason I keep running into these issues is that I keep switching between Git and Mercurial for certain projects.

Add your username and email to the global git ==version 1.9.2== config:

`>>> git config --global user.name "Your username"`

`>>> git config --global email "Your email address"`

Specify a default editor after you run git commit:

`>>> git config --global core-editor your-editor-name>`
