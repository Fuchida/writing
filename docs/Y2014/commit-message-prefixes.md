title: Commit Messages Prefixes
date: 2014

 I find it very useful to prefix my commits with a verb that specifies the type of commit I made. This makes it much easier for me to find out at a glance what a commit has done.

 This is generally common practice from what I've seen in open source software. An example commit would be ==Fix the user lookup function so that deactivated users are returned as well==

Here are the examples of my prefixes and what I mean by them

* **Fix** = Make a change that corrects a problem
* **Update** = Make a change to outdated information
* **Add** = Insert new functionality that was not previously there
* **Change** = Modify existing information or application state, even though the previous state was correct. I would use this prefix for aesthetic changes, refactoring, idiomising code or performance increase changes.
* **Remove** = Take out any information or code that is obsolete and no longer needed.
