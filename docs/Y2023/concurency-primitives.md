* mutexes: a locking mechanism to synchronize access to a
shared resource

* Semaphores: a signaling mechanism to control access to a shared
resource

* Deadlock: programming error where a collection of tasks are all
waiting for a lock/semaphore but the lock is not

* Channels a method for interprocess communication (local or
